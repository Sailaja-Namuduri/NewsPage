## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Toggle the mobile menu 

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS flex
- JavaScript

### Continued development

I would like to improve the styling in mobile view. I am satisfied with desktop view. But I would like to know the way I implemented is the right way because this was my first project.
